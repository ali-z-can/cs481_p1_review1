Since all the functions are included in one file named "main.c" only that file need to be compiled so a simple command like,

gcc -o hw1 main.c 

is enough to compile my code. Even compilation is not complicated since my code is written in C it depends on some linux environent variables and libraries. The list of required libraries is: 

 <stdio.h>
<stdlib.h>
<errno.h>
<sys/time.h>
<ctype.h>
